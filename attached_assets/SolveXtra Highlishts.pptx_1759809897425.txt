Highlights  
Lowlights  
✅One new partner added with 4 new LOBs onboarded. Bandwidth managed within existing team

✅ 6 long-pending customer issues (each with over 30+ interactions) were expedited and resolved after being highlighted by the QA team. These cases were from critical LOBs – Email and Social Media.

✅ Low rebuttal reversal rate of 0.39%, indicating strong audit accuracy and process control
❌ Team faced delays in ID creation for new LOBs, resulting in no audits post-training

❌ Calibration sessions between partner and SolveXtra have not resumed. Only one session conducted in the entire month.

❌ No L2-level rebuttals raised in the month. Engagement and discussions with partners have come to a halt
Support Required
Monthly Calibrations- Calibrations to be conducted at least once a month for all LOBs to ensure alignment and clarity on audit parameters

Expansion of Audit Scope - Compliance and Process audits need to be initiated. Currently, only BAU audits are being executed; expansion is required for holistic quality control
