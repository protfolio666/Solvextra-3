Studying Escalations for Process Improvement
15 recent escalated cases studied across Logistics, Policy, Technical, Process, Agent, and Installation categories
Analysis covered both customer-facing symptoms and internal process limitations
Methodology:
Data Source: Escalation logs from the past 20 days. June Cases only. Interaction  and incident level details studies and resolution workflows challenged. 
Root Cause Identification: Categorized based on primary and sub-reasons. Mapped escalation triggers to internal process behaviors
Process Discovery: Identified L1/L2 hand-off delays, system limitations, and policy rigidities. 
Recommendation: Proposed actionable, role-specific interventions. Solutions aimed at improving FCR, reducing TAT, and enhancing CX
Change Required : current process studies only incident level data instead of customer journey. 

15 Escalation Cases - Logistics
Cases with issues related to Logistics - 9 out of 15 - 60%

Primary Causes 
Delivery Issues - Delay in delivery, Delay in shipping
Return Related - Replacement Reflecting on Hold
Delivery Executive behavior- Resulting in Social media issue
Sample Case Details - XXXXXXXXXXXX
Order created on 23rd may. Order delivery date 28th. May. Large appliance order. Faulty product delivered. Customer escalated {2nd June} through multiple channels including twitter. Return pickup due for 9th June was cancelled by logistics without informing customer. Customer escalated on twitter. Escalation team created another ticket for return, return date 19th June & Replacement Date as 4-July.

Total Customer Effort (in days): 42 days
Total RR responses - 3 {all No}
L1 team doesn’t  have empowerment to talk to Logistics. 
Takeaway: cancellation without informing customer results in cusotmer dissatisfaction

15 Escalation Cases - Logistics
Cases with issues related to Logistics - 9 out of 15 - 60%

Sample Case Details - XXXXXXXXXX
Customer ordered an electronic product. Order value approx. 5K. Issue 1 - Different agents informed them the product was still in transit or had reached the wrong location, and the delay was due to courier issues. The product was lost in transit, and the replacement got cancelled without informing the customer. This caused more frustration, especially since they were on medical leave and couldn’t afford further delays. They also faced issues updating their phone number and delivery address.

Customer in his/her email mentioned multiple issues, including product not working, all orders being delayed. Couldn’t find any “Return / Replacement order” or any documentation by agent to resolve this part of customer complaint. 

Total Customer Effort (Total touchpoints): 22 calls over 21 days. Total 18 handoffs during this process. 
Takeaway: Define attempt threshold for marking a case as “High Priority” and triggering relationship management. Queue sizing and SOPs need further discussion.

Customer Journey Analytics - RCA Approach 
In the past two weeks, our team independently analyzed 60 cases to develop an RCA (Root Cause Analysis) approach tailored to Brand’s new ways of working.

The next four slides offer a quick overview of the surprising insights we uncovered during this exercise including ...
Handoff gaps across channels & departments
Gaps around actual response and resolution times against expected SLAs.
Common drop-off points or repeat contact loops
Reasons for escalation or dissatisfaction
How issues or queries move across teams.
Policy & Process Alignment
Technology Experience

Artificial Inflation of Resolution Rate
Total Customer Journey Studied - 60 
Total RR response in these cases - 600 {Yes - 161 , No - 439}
Resolution Rate - {161/600 = 27%}
Unethically Gained Responses - 45 {22+23}
Unethically Gained RR% on Yeses - {45/161 - 28%}
Actual Resolution Rate -  {116/555 = 21%}
Unethically Gained Response % - {{27% -21%) / 21%} = 29%}
Sample Case Details - TechM {Noida}
In one customer journey, 22 “Yes” responses were logged against a single cancelled order. NOTE : Order is from 2018 & is the only order on that customer’s account. 
Further review revealed 25 incidents with 94 taggings done. 
All these taggings within just 2 agents. 
All incidents were marked “solved,” 
Zero Calls to customer on this Case 
Takeaway: Resolution Rate looks overstated by nearly 29% due to tampering.

Tech Issues : Survey Trigger Algoritham
Journey Node : Pre-Delivery 
Survey Trigger Flaws: 
 In case ID XXXXXXXX, the system shows only two resolution attempts between April 13th and 15th. However, 10 survey responses marked as "No" were recorded during this time, indicating either tech issue or process issue in survey triggering process or in survey capture process
Total Customer Journey Studied - 60 
Journeys with Trigger Flaws - 3
% Survey Trigger flaw - 3/60 = 5%
Extra NOs received in these two cases - {8 + 2 + 2 = 12}
Total NOs including Extra - 29
Actual NOs - (29 - 12) = 17
Extra "NOs" responses account for approximately 41.4% of "NOs" for journeys with trigger flaws. 
Takeaway: Resolution Rate calculations are compromised by underlying system issues. 41.4% found in samples

Insightful Findings : Customer Journey Analysis
High Value Product not being delivered with OTP delivery feature resulting in following issues  
Journey Node : Pre-Delivery 
Delivery Executive closed the case as “Delivered” without delivering
When customer asked for “Tamil” agent support, agent didn’t transfer or arranged call back. 
Customer effort : 21 Calls; over 30-day period. Minimum 21 handoffs as every time new agent was answering
Agents continuously marked issue resolved after “Control Tower” update. Not believing customer.
Agents continuously marked issue resolved after “Control Tower” update. Not believing customer.
Takeaway: Why are Delivery Executives marking product delivered without delivering?

Need further discussion with Brand team
The furniture was never recovered, and Brand issued a refund without locating the order.

Insightful Findings : Customer Journey Analysis
Delivery Executive took OTP over the call, did not deliver product but marked it as delivered
Journey Node : Pre-Delivery 
Delivery Executive took 6 days to finally deliver the product although OTP was taken on call on the 1st day
Because OTP was given by customer CC team continuously closed case by saying “product was delivered”
Customer effort : 19 Calls; over 6-day period. Minimum 18 handoffs as every time new agent was answering
KNE transfer was made twice and KNE tried to resolve the issue by taking Delivery Executive and customer in conference
Delivery Executive delayed the product delivery
Takeaway: How can we ensure that customer stops sharing OTP over phone. how can stop Delivery Executives marking product delivered without delivering?

Wrong Disposition
Not able to change disposition
Customer effort
Customer lost hope and stopped calling
Because COD order no refund was possible
Delivery Executive disposed a COD order as “Cancelled” after delivering
CC team not able to change disposition and continously giving resolution basis “Cancelled” status
Customer called 19 times, total 18 handoffs as different agents attended this call
Customer sent photographs, order id details explained that he paid for the order but no resolution
In case it would have been a “Prepaid order” then logistics could have cancelled it and then customer would have received refund

Peer to Peer Review Methodology
The Why – Challenges & Risk that Brand might {will} face in Distributed Partner, processes and workflow environment. 
The How – SolveXtra proposal to manage this complexity and how Four-Step Pyramidal Framework will help along with Peer Reviews
 The Impact – Tangible Benefits & Wins that can be expected

The How – SolveXtra proposal to manage this complexity by introducing Peer to Peer Reviews
Adults learn best through observation and hands-on practice. Peer-to-peer reviews turn every agent into a quality analyst and a coach within a focused, practical scope.
What is Peer to Peer Review
How
Each agent is assigned one peer case daily—from the same team, process, or line of business—to review and provide constructive feedback to colleague.
How will this help 
Agents are no longer just executors—they’re active contributors to improvement initiatives, helping Brand foster a culture of quality conversations across the network.

 The Impact – Tangible Benefits & Wins that can be expected
Culture shift: Agents learn from peers, not just supervisors. Peer learning is the best form of learning as there is more acceptability & will to learn
Metric that will move
More Ground Reporting: Nothing beats ground-level insights—'doers' know best. With agents submitting one review a day, Brand gains 5,000 frontline observations daily—rich, real-time input straight from the field.
Scalability
Real-Time Adaptability
Empowerment of Agents
Faster Problem Resolution 
Boosted Engagement and Ownership

Proposal 
Use SAAs Platform which can help in Peer-to-Peer review process
Use SAAS platform SolveXtra  for Customer journey assignment instead of just transaction monitoring. 
Assignment
